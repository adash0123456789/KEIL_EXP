Analog to Digital Converter Example Program
===========================================
Project: ADC
Author:  E. Healy

This example program shows how to configure and use the
A/D Converter of the following microcontrollers:

* Atmel AT91SAM7S32
* Atmel AT91SAM7S64
* Atmel AT91SAM7S128
* Atmel AT91SAM7S256

After configuring the A/D Converter, the program reads
A/D channel 0 and outputs the converted value using the serial 
port.

To run this program...

1. Select the device (Options for Target - Device)
2. Build the project (Project - Build Target)
3. Start the uVision Debugger
4. Click the Serial #1 tab
5. Click Go or Run (F5)
6. Click on the Toolbox buttons to change input voltages


A debug script (debug.ini) creates buttons that set different 
analog values in A/D channels.  As the program runs, you 
will see the A/D input and output change.

Other buttons create signals that generate sine wave 
or sawtooth patterns as analog inputs.  µVision3 users may 
enable the built-in Logic Analyzer to view, measure and compare
these input signals graphically.
