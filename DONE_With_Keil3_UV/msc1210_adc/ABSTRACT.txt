Analog to Digital Converter Example Program
===========================================
Project:  ADC

This example project shows how to configure and use the A/D Converter
of the following microcontrollers:

   * Texas Instruments MSC1210Y2
   * Texas Instruments MSC1210Y3
   * Texas Instruments MSC1210Y4
   * Texas Instruments MSC1210Y5

To run this program...

1. Build the project (Project - Build Target)
2. Start the uVision Debugger
3. Open the Serial Window (View - Serial Window 1)
4. Open the Toolbox (View - Toolbox)
5. Click Go or Run (F5)
6. Click on the Toolbox buttons to change input voltages

The ADC program reads all eight analog inputs of the
MSC1200 and outputs the values along with other 
A/D relevant information via the serial interface.

This example shows a simple method to convert the A/D HEX
values into a voltage value that is more readable.  The 
algorithm uses only long arithmetic and avoids any loss of
precision as it would be the case when using single precision
floating point arithmetic.

A debug script (debug.ini) creates buttons that set different 
analog values in A/D channels.  As the program runs, you 
will see the A/D input and output change.

Other buttons create signals that generate a sine wave 
or sawtooth patterns as analog inputs.  µVision3 users may 
enable the built-in Logic Analyzer to view, measure and compare
these input signals graphically.
