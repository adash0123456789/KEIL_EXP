The DTMF project implements a DTMF detection algoritm for the 
STMicroelectronics STM32F103RB device. 

The project contains three targets:

- Simulator for verification in the uVision simulator
- AutoTest for autmatic testing in the uVision simulator
- MCBSTM32 Flash for Flash Downloading and Target test

The Simulator target uses signal functions (defined in the 
debugger init file Debugger.INI) to generate various DTMF 
signal patterns. The signal function can be invoked with
various parameters using the Toolbox buttons. With Code 
Coverage you may check if all paths of DTMF algorithm
are executed. This is useful during program verification but
also helps to identify redundant code in a program.

The AutoTest target can be invoked with the batch file AutoTest.BAT
which starts the debug mode of uVision.  The debugger init file
AutoTest.INI executes automatically the DTMF signal functions and
creates a log file of the program execution.
